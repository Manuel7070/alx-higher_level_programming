This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum, covering Python programming and focusing on Data Structures like Lists and Tuples. The project started on Nov 3, 2023, at 6:00 AM, and must be completed by Nov 7, 2023, at 6:00 AM. The checker for this project was released on Nov 4, 2023, at 6:00 AM. An auto review will be launched at the deadline.
