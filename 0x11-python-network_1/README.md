# 0x11. Python - Network #1

## Description
This repository contains Python scripts for fetching internet resources, decoding urllib body responses, making HTTP requests using urllib and requests packages, fetching JSON resources, and manipulating data from external services. It is part of an ongoing second chance project initiated by Guillaume, CTO at Holberton School, on Mar 1, 2024. The project must be completed by Mar 6, 2024, 6:00 AM, and an auto review will be launched at the deadline.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to fetch internet resources with the Python package urllib
- Understand how to decode urllib body responses
- Use the Python package requests for making HTTP requests
- Learn to make HTTP GET, POST, PUT, etc. requests
- Fetch JSON resources and manipulate data from external services

## Resources
- [HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib Package](link)
- [Quickstart with Requests package](link)
- [Requests package](link)

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Use `get` to access dictionary values by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
