# alx-higher_level_programming

## Overview
Welcome to the **alx-higher_level_programming** repository! This repository contains Python, Shell, and C scripts created as part of the Alx Higher Level Programming curriculum. Here, we focus on learning and practicing various programming concepts and languages, including Python, Shell scripting, and C programming.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)
- All files must be executable

### Shell Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- All files must be executable

### C Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- All header files should be include guarded

## More Info
For more information on Python, Shell scripting, and C programming, check out the Zen of Python by Tim Peters, and the Pycodestyle guidelines.

**Zen of Python, by Tim Peters**
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than right now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

**Pycodestyle**
- Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code.
