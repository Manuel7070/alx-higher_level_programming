# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Project Overview

This project introduces the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. OOP is a fundamental programming paradigm that emphasizes creating objects to represent real-world entities and their interactions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Explain the key concepts of OOP, including classes, objects, attributes, methods, data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. Create and utilize classes to model real-world entities and their behavior.

3. Understand the difference between public, protected, and private attributes and methods.

4. Implement getters and setters to control access to object attributes.

5. Employ dynamic attribute creation to extend object functionality.

6. Understand the concept of the `__dict__` attribute and its role in attribute access.

7. Utilize the `getattr` function to retrieve attributes dynamically.

## Requirements

1. Use the specified editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.

2. Develop code using Python 3 (version 3.8.5) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

3. Terminate all Python files with a new line character.

4. Begin each Python file with the line `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

5. Create a mandatory `README.md` file at the project root directory.

6. Adhere to the `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.8.*).

7. Ensure all files are executable.

8. Use the `wc` tool to check the length of each file.

9. Implement documentation for all modules, classes, and functions using the specified commands.

10. Write comprehensive documentation, not just single words, explaining the purpose of each module, class, or method.

## Getting Started

1. Create a project directory for this project.

2. Inside the project directory, create a `README.md` file and paste the project overview and requirements sections of this document.

3. Start exploring the provided resources to gain a thorough understanding of OOP concepts.

4. As you learn, begin practicing OOP principles by creating Python classes and objects.

5. Utilize the provided examples and exercises to solidify your understanding of OOP concepts.

6. Refer back to the learning objectives throughout the project to ensure you are achieving them.

7. Seek assistance from the course instructors or teaching assistants if you encounter any difficulties.
