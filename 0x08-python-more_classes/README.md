## Resources
### Read or Watch:
- [Object Oriented Programming](link) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](link) (Be cautious: Read specific paragraphs as mentioned in the instructions)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](link)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](link)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](link) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
